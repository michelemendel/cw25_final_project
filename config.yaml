# Subfinder configuration
subfinder:
  # Use all available sources for enumeration (slower but more comprehensive)
  use_all_sources: true
  # Use recursive sources to find subdomains recursively
  recursive: true
  # Active enumeration: perform DNS resolution to only show subdomains that actually resolve
  # This filters out wildcard DNS entries and invalid subdomains (slower but more accurate)
  active: true
  # Puredns configuration:
  # Brute-force enumeration: try common subdomain names from a wordlist
  # This is slower but can find subdomains that passive enumeration misses
  brute_force: false # Set to true to enable brute-force
  wordlist: wordlists/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt # Path to wordlist file
  brute_force_threads: 100 # Number of concurrent DNS queries for brute-force
  resolvers_file: '' # Path to DNS resolvers file (optional, defaults to ~/.config/puredns/resolvers.txt, will be auto-generated if missing)
# Httpx configuration
httpx:
  # Filter out status codes (comma-separated, e.g., "404,403,401")
  # This prevents 404 pages from being passed to vulnerability scanner, saving time
  # Set to empty string "" to include all status codes
  filter_status_codes: '404'

# Nuclei vulnerability scanning configuration
#
# Templates: Specify which Nuclei template directories to use
# Examples:
#   - http/                          # All HTTP templates (SLOWEST, most comprehensive)
#   - http/cves/                     # Only CVE-specific templates (faster)
#   - http/misconfiguration/         # Misconfiguration templates
#   - http/exposed-panels/           # Exposed admin panels, dashboards
#   - http/vulnerabilities/          # General vulnerabilities
#   - http/technologies/             # Technology-specific (e.g., WordPress, Jira)
#   - http/default-logins/           # Default credentials
#   - http/takeovers/                # Subdomain takeovers
#   - http/exposures/                # Information exposures
#   - http/cves/2024/                # Specific year CVEs (FASTEST for targeted scans)
#   - http/cves/2024/CVE-2024-1234*  # Specific CVE pattern
#
# To speed up scans, use specific directories instead of broad ones:
#   FAST: http/cves/2024/, http/exposed-panels/
#   MEDIUM: http/cves/, http/misconfiguration/, http/exposures/
#   SLOW: http/ (scans everything)
vulnerability_templates:
  - http/
  # - http/cves/, http/misconfiguration/, http/exposures/

# Tags: Filter templates by vulnerability tags (comma-separated in Nuclei)
# Examples:
#   - cve          # CVE-related vulnerabilities
#   - exposure     # Information exposure
#   - rce          # Remote code execution
#   - xss          # Cross-site scripting
#   - sqli         # SQL injection
#   - lfi          # Local file inclusion
#   - rfi          # Remote file inclusion
#   - ssrf         # Server-side request forgery
#   - auth         # Authentication issues
#   - config       # Configuration issues
#   - file         # File-related vulnerabilities
#   - iot          # IoT device vulnerabilities
#   - network      # Network-related issues
#   - panel        # Admin panels
#   - takeover     # Subdomain takeovers
#   - tech         # Technology-specific
#   - wordpress    # WordPress-specific
#   - apache       # Apache-specific
#   - nginx        # Nginx-specific
#
# To speed up scans, use specific tags:
#   FAST: [cve,exposure] - focuses on high-impact findings
#   MEDIUM: [cve,exposure,rce,sqli] - common critical issues
#   SLOW: [] - no filtering (scans all templates matching the template paths above)
#
# Note: Tags work in combination with templates - both filters apply
vulnerability_tags: []
# vulnerability_tags: [cve, exposure, rce, sqli]

# Concurrency: Number of parallel nuclei processes to run during vulnerability scanning
# The vulnerability scanner splits all live hosts into batches and runs multiple nuclei
# processes in parallel to speed up scanning. Each process scans a subset of the URLs.
#
# How it works:
#   - URLs are divided into N batches (where N = concurrency value)
#   - Each batch runs in a separate nuclei process simultaneously
#   - Results from all batches are merged into the final output file
#
# Recommendations:
#   - LOW (10-20): For slower systems or when scanning many targets to avoid overwhelming the system
#   - MEDIUM (30-50): Good balance for most systems (default: 50)
#   - HIGH (50-100+): For powerful systems with many CPU cores and sufficient memory
#
# Note: Higher concurrency = faster scans but more CPU/memory usage. If you experience
# system slowdowns or out-of-memory errors, reduce this value.
concurrency: 80

# Workflow timeout - use duration format (e.g., "60m", "2h")
# This is the maximum time a workflow can run before timing out
timeout: 90m
output_dir: out
